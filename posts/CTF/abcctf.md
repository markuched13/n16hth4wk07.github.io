Hmmmm we got an IP and a port, let's us nmap to check and  know what service is running on that port.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~]
â””â”€$ nmap -sC -sV  185.203.119.220 -p 8003

nice we got somethings interesting but trust me you'll only want to take a look at the webdav directory.

hmmmmmm... We are asked to login ðŸ˜¬. but hope you did not forget what Muzec-san left for us in the default apache web source page "abcctf should help you in your journey...." ðŸ˜‰, so let's try login with username: abcctf and password:abcctf.

Boom! we are in and we can see the file nothing.txt... let's check its content

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194123641-6ce5f4a2-ed4d-48b6-b238-c3ec8eb48f98.png)

lol nothing really???? let's scroll down to the bottom of the page

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194123866-9fd5e243-27f0-498c-a974-6cfc1dc925f2.png)

there's a piece of advice to prevent other players from either gaining access with your shell or get hint from it ðŸ˜‰.
Now we know it's running webdav, let's exploit our way and gain reverse shell. in this process we would be using cadaver to upload our shell then get a reverse shell shell. 

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~/abcctf/method]
â””â”€$ cadaver http://185.203.119.220:8003/webdav/

now let's ping our ngrok.io to get an ip address
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~/abcctf/method]
â””â”€$ ping -c 2 2.tcp.eu.ngrok.io
