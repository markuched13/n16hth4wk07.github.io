First start with nmap scan.

`nmap -p- --min-rate 1000 -oN fulltcp.txt -v -Pn <IP>`

```

Now we know what ports are open, let run nmap default scripts to know what services are running on those ports.

`nmap -sC -sV -oN normal.tcp -p 22,139,445,631,2181,2222,8080,8081,36233 -Pn <IP>`

Now we know what services are running, started by checking port 8081 (http).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/211188740-aaabcf9f-13c1-4070-9559-bc0816e9752f.png)

Checking port 8081 redirected me to 8080, and as we can see it is running exhibitor web ui v1.0, let's check for exploit.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/211188859-dc3ee008-f720-45c1-aec1-0b2f5ccbabe7.png)

found an exploit on searchsploit. let's implement what the exploits does.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/211189069-02c6d646-cd02-4076-915a-135dc147c568.png)

turn on editing, inject a reverse shell payload, fire up netcat listener and click on commit.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/211189220-e722e7f1-9534-43c0-93e6-eef7b2774c24.png)

click on commit all at once , it will save and check back ncat listener.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/211189253-fb525919-fb8b-46d2-9b86-0d2d2e42647b.png)

Bull's eye we got a reverse shell. stabilize the shell and let's escalate privs.

```
charles@pelican:/opt/zookeeper$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for charles on pelican:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User charles may run the following commands on pelican:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gcore
charles@pelican:/opt/zookeeper$
```

first i checked for sudo permissions using command `sudo -l` i found out that user charles is allow to run `/usr/bin/gcore` as root without password. doing some researching about escalating privs with gcore.
gcore can be used to generate core dumps of running processes. Such files often contains sensitive information such as open files content, cryptographic keys, passwords, etc. This command produces a binary file named core.$PID, that is then often filtered with strings to narrow down relevant information.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/211189536-82f899c5-cf23-4f89-8274-99f7eeda38b6.png)

using th command `ps -aux | grep root` to show process running as root, in the process id PID 492: we can see the process that root is running `/usr/bin/password-store`. now let use gcore to dump the process core.

```
charles@pelican:/opt/zookeeper$ sudo /usr/bin/gcore 492
0x00007f12bb31f6f4 in __GI___nanosleep (requested_time=requested_time@entry=0x7fffb07c5dc0, remaining=remaining@entry=0x7fffb07c5dc0) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/nanosleep.c:28
28      ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/nanosleep.c: No such file or directory.
Saved corefile core.492
[Inferior 1 (process 492) detached]
charles@pelican:/opt/zookeeper$ ls -al core.492
-rw-r--r-- 1 charles charles 354448 Jan  8 04:46 core.492
charles@pelican:/opt/zookeeper$ 
```

now we dumped the process into a core file save as core.492, let's use strings to make the file a human readable format.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/211189871-f5f6bb34-fdb8-42a2-bbc0-e01dbdc95133.png)

using strings to make the core.492 file readable, i saw `001 Password: root:` which might be a potential root password. let's try it out cause no harm in trying.ðŸ¤“

And Boom!!! we got root... An intrsting box yeahðŸ˜‰
