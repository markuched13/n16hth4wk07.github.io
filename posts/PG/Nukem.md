First Enumeration with nmap

`nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 -oN fulltcp.txt -v -Pn <IP>`

```

Now we know what ports are open, let's run default nmap scripts to know what services are running on those ports.

cool we now know what services are running on those ports. Let's start enumeration with port 80.

Nice, seems the web service is running a wordpress cms, let's enumerate wordpress using wpscan to enumerate plugins, themes and users.

`wpscan --url http://192.168.79.105/ --enumerate p,t,u`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/210873558-0652681b-9984-45cd-bf0c-0dad13e19edb.png)

Nice we got available plugins `simple file list` & `tutor`. Let's chck online for public exploit.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/210874945-ba84831b-6add-4bf3-99aa-9aa0b9bf12a5.png)

Found a public exploit on exploitdb. This exploit let's us execute an arbitary file upload and get a reverse shell. Let's download and edit the exploit.

cool, ran the exploit and got a reverse shell, stabilize the shell and escalate privs.

Found some mysql creds in the wp-config.php file in the /src/http dir.

```                                                                                                                                                 
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hth4wk-sec)-[~/Documents/PGP/Nukem]
â””â”€$ ssh commander@192.168.79.105                       
commander@192.168.79.105's password: 
[commander@nukem ~]$ id
uid=1000(commander) gid=1000(commander) groups=1000(commander)
[commander@nukem ~]$ whoai 
-bash: whoai: command not found
[commander@nukem ~]$ whoami
commander
[commander@nukem ~]$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for commander: 
Sorry, user commander may not run sudo on nukem.
[commander@nukem ~]$ 
```

I tried using thos creds to login ssh and it worked. I did `sudo -l` the user commander is not in the sudoers file. Let's esclate privs further.

Doing `netstat -ano` I found a service running on port 5901 as local host. 

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hth4wk-sec)-[~/Documents/PGP/Nukem]
â””â”€$ ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 commander@192.168.79.105
commander@192.168.79.105's password: 
Last login: Thu Jan  5 21:28:07 2023 from 192.168.49.79
[commander@nukem ~]$ ls
Desktop  local.txt  python_rest_flask
[commander@nukem ~]$ 
```

I did forwarded the port 5901 to my local machine using ssh. now let's check for suid on the target box.

Got an suid `dosbox`. DOSBox is a free and open-source emulator which runs software for MS-DOS compatible disk operating systemsâ€”primarily video games. It was first released in 2002, when DOS technology was becoming obsolete. Its adoption for running DOS games is widespread, with it being used in commercial re-releases of those games as well. DOSBox can be downloaded and used from the video game console emulator front-end RetroArch. 
dosbox is a gui application. remembered we port forwarded a vnc port to our local host. Let's check it out.

`vncviewer 127.0.0.1:5901`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/210889168-48d243a1-d39a-4134-bfc6-993c3a8be800.png)

We got a vnc session using the password we found earlier. now let's start the dosbox

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/210890886-040ee5d6-7bf5-452d-b191-a915782a2df8.png)

Now we've started dosbox. So dosbox is a kinda emulator,  so you're running the dos operating system. so you'll need to mount the files we need.

```
mount C: / to mount the / dir
C:/ to switch to the mount dir
```

now that we've mounted the c drive to etc we can read the shadow file type shadow and since we have read/write permissions we should be able to write our user to the /etc/sudoers file

`echo commander ALL=(ALL) ALL >>sudoers`.

and back in our shell we should be able to upgrade out session with sudo -l and enter the password.

Boom! we got rootðŸ¤
