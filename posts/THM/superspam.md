General Uvilix:

Good Morning! Our intel tells us that he has returned. Super-spam, the evil alien villain from the planet Alpha Solaris IV from the outer reaches of the Andromeda Galaxy. 
He is a most wanted notorious cosmos hacker who has made it his lifetime mission to attack every Linux server possible on his journey to a Linux-free galaxy. 
As an avid Windows proponent, Super-spam has now arrived on Earth and has managed to hack into OUR Linux machine in pursuit of his ultimate goal. 
We must regain control of our server before it's too late! Find a way to hack back in to discover his next evil plan for total Windows domination! Beware, super-spam's evil powers are to confuse and deter his victims.
```

First we start with an nmap scan

`nmap -sC -sV -T4 -oN nmap.txt <IP>`
